## 3. Build Process

You can trigger builds in four ways:

- [Manual](./3.1 Manual.md)
- [Git push](./3.2 Git push.md)
- [Pull request](./3.3 Pull request.md)
- [Daily build (scheduled trigger)](./3.4 Daily build (scheduled trigger).md)

After start building, you can see the status of your builds in the “Builds” menu. On the screenshot below you can see a list of builds, each color represents a different status of the Build:

- Yellow: queueing
- Green: build has passed
- Blue: building in progress
- Red: build has failed
